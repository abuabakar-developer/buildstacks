# âœ… Email Setup Verified for BuildStack

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Current Configuration
Your `.env.local` file has the correct email credentials:

```env
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=mu712576@gmail.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PASS=wusn ubzk fdqt bdms
EMAIL_FROM=mu712576@gmail.com
```

## ðŸ”§ What I Fixed

### 1. **Environment Variable Names** âœ…
- Updated nodemailer to use `EMAIL_SERVER_USER` and `EMAIL_SERVER_PASS`
- Added fallback to `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` for compatibility

### 2. **Email Template Function Calls** âœ…
- Fixed the way email templates are called with proper parameters
- Added better error handling and logging

### 3. **Transporter Configuration** âœ…
- Added SSL/TLS security settings
- Added transporter verification on startup
- Better error logging

### 4. **TypeScript Support** âœ…
- Installed `@types/nodemailer` for proper TypeScript support
- Fixed all type errors
